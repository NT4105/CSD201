# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java, including:

- Sorting Algorithms
- Hash Tables
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks and Queues

## Sorting Algorithms

### Basic Sorting

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Advanced Sorting

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Hash Tables

Implementation of a hash table using chaining for collision resolution. The hash function maps strings based on their first character.

Key features:

- Insert
- Search
- Delete
- Display

## Linked Lists

### Basic Linked List

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Display

### Advanced Linked List

- Doubly Linked List

## Trees

### Binary Tree

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Display

### Binary Search Tree

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Display

## Graphs

### Directed Graph

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Display

### Undirected Graph

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Display

## Stacks and Queues

### Stack

- Push
- Pop
- Display

### Queue

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Display

## Graph Algorithms

Implementation of graph algorithms including:

- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
